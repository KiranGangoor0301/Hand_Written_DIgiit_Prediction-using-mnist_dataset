## Requirements

Before you start building the model, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python (3.9 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or higher) or PyTorch (1.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for experimentation)

You can install Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Data Preparation

1. **Download MNIST Dataset**: You can easily download the MNIST dataset using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. For example, using TensorFlow:

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

   (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the pixel values of the images to the range [0, 1] and one-hot encode the labels (if using TensorFlow) or leave them as integers (if using PyTorch).

## Building the Model

You can choose to build a simple feedforward neural network or a neural network for this task. Here's an example of building a simple feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten the 28x28 image to a 1D array
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 classes (digits 0-9)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

If you prefer PyTorch, you can create a similar architecture using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.

## Training the Model

Now, you can train the model on the training data:

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

Make sure to experiment with hyperparameters like the number of epochs, batch size, and model architecture to achieve better results.

## Evaluating the Model

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:

```python
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")
```

## Making Predictions

To make predictions on new handwritten digits, you can use the trained model:

```python
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

## Visualization (Optional)

You can visualize the model's predictions and the dataset using Matplotlib or any other data visualization library.
